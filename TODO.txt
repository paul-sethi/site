-hover on mobile dropdown menu background color wrong
-media sizing wrong (can see wrapping on nav bar before turning into dropdown menu, ~600px)

	- change i and j variables to row/column throughout
	- change selected color to red? or pick new color scheme for all pages
	- select all, clear all hands, add buttons to select all or clear specific rows/columns?
